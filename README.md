## ProdexAI (Backend App)

#### AWS Bedrock + LlamaIndex

Goal was to create a universal template based web app for sellers so they can simply upload pictures and minimum details of products. LLM based web app will automatically extract relevant info from image, convert data into a template based on destination service or e-commerce marketplace (Amazon, Instagram, etc.)
